Create a `Food` class that has the attributes:
-   name
-   description

and the method:
- cost()

1). Create 3 Classes that inherit the `Food` class, each sub-class/child-class of Food must override the cost method to return a value unique to that particular object.

2). In your main/runner, create an ArrayList of Food and populate it with instances of different child classes.

3). loop through the array and calculate the total cost of the items stored in the array
